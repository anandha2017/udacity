# Udacity Intro to Machine Learning Example 3 Author ID Accuracy

I cloned https://github.com/udacity/ud120-projects to a completely separate directory structure. I've copied the tools directory from ud120-project here to get each assignment to work. I've excluded uploading maildir/* as that is a waste of space and time.

To get Docker to work, need to mount tools and maildir into Docker image. See https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/

* tools is located here ~/Documents/Udacity/ud120 Intro to Machine Learning/tools
* maildir is located here ~/Documents/Udacity/ud120 Intro to Machine Learning/maildir

And the run file in the directory shows how I ran it. This start with assignment 3
